**BIG DATA**
Big data is the collection of data sets so large and complex to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing application.

The challenges include capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis, and visualization.

**IBM Definition for BIG DATA**
Big data is a term applied to data sets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional relational databases to capture, manage, and process the data with low-latency. And it has one or more of the following characteristics – high volume, high velocity, or high variety. Big data comes from sensors, devices, video/audio, networks, log files, transactional applications, web, and social media - much of it generated in real time and in a very large scale.

Analyzing big data allows analysts, researchers, and business users to make better and faster decisions using data that was previously inaccessible or unusable. Using advanced analytics techniques such as text analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, data mining, statistics, and natural language processing, businesses can analyze previously untapped data sources independent or together with their existing enterprise data to gain new insights resulting in better and faster decisions

**Big DATA Characteristics**

The five characteristics that define Big Data is Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value.

Volume refers to the ‘amount of data’, which is growing day by day at a very fast pace. The size of data generated by humans, machines and their interactions on social media itself is massive.


Velocity is defined as the pace at which different sources generate the data every day. This flow of data is massive and continuous

Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness.

After discussing Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity, there is another V that should be taken into account when looking at Big Data i.e. Value. It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into value it is useless
